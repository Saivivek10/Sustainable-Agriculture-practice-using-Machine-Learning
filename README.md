Precision farming is in trend nowadays. Itâ€™s an approach where inputs are utilised in very precise amounts to get increased average yields for optimum profitability.
Crop prediction is methodology is used to predict the suitable crop by sensing various parameter of soil (such as PH, Nitrogen, phosphate,potassium)and also parameter related
to atmosphere (such as humidity,rainfall,temperature).
ML can be used to obtain the precise inputs to make the yield more lucrative.
